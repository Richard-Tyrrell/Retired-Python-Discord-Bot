# Retired-Python-Discord-Bot
This was my first discord bot that I maintained over ~2 years. It has a repository of different resources ranging from educational topics for cs 288 at NJIT to personal project information.

procfile is letting Heroku know what type to use. In this case it's a worker require python and I foolishly named my bot main.py.
Reuirements is letting heroku which packages to install. In this case it's discord.py.
